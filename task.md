Task: Create a Dynamic Todo Application
Objective:
Build a Todo application where users can add, edit, delete, and filter tasks. The app should also save tasks to local storage so they persist across page reloads.

Technologies: ReactJs, Redux, MUI

Requirements:
Components:

TodoListComponent: Displays the list of todos.

TodoItemComponent: Represents each todo item, allowing for editing and deletion.

TodoFormComponent: A form to add new todos.

FilterComponent: Allows users to filter todos based on status (All, Completed, Pending).

Functionality:

Add Todo: Users can add a new todo item with a description and due date.

Edit Todo: Users can edit the description or due date of an existing todo.

Delete Todo: Users can remove a todo item.

Toggle Completion: Users can mark a todo as completed or pending.

Filter Todos: Users can filter the list to show all, only completed, or only pending todos.

Local Storage: Save the todos in local storage so that they persist even after a page reload.

State Management:

Use useState for managing the local component state.

Optionally, if the candidate is familiar, they can use useReducer for managing more complex state logic.

Styling:

Basic styling using CSS modules, inline styles, or a CSS-in-JS solution.

The UI should be responsive and user-friendly.

Submission:

The candidate should submit their solution via a GitHub repository or zip file.

Ensure meaningful commit messages and a clear README explaining how to run the app.

Evaluation Criteria:
Code Quality: Clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.

Component Reusability: Effective use of reusable components.

State Management: Proper use of React hooks for managing state.

Functionality: Meets all the required features with optional bonuses being a plus.
